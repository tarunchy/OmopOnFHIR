## Overall Solution Architecture

## Hosted Runner Setup

### Create a folder in server where Hosted Runner will be installed

#### Download

$ mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner# Download the latest runner package

$ curl -o actions-runner-osx-x64-2.278.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.278.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.278.0.tar.gz

#### Extract the installer

$ tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.278.0.tar.gz

#### Configure

##### Create the runner and start the configuration experience

$ ./config.sh --url https://github.com/tarunchy/OmopOnFHIR --token ****(This can be retrived by clicking Settings->Actions->Runners->Add Self-Hosted runner)****

##### Last step, run it!

$ ./run.sh

#### Using self-hosted runner .github->workflow->pipeline.yaml file

##### Use this YAML in your workflow file for each job

runs-on: self-hosted

## Partial Automation of DB Setup

DB Setup is partially atuomated due licesning issue with different codes and vacculebary. Following Steps needs to be followed to configure database

### 1. Create Github Action Workflow

A Github action workflow called https://github.com/tarunchy/OmopOnFHIR/blob/main/.github/workflows/posgress.yaml created which needs to be triggered manually.

### 2. Load Data Manually

This is manul step and needs to be completed based on existing envionment setup document - OMOPonFHIR â€“ FHIR R4 to OMOP v6.0

Based on the document some of the key steps are:

a. git clone https://github.gatech.edu/cs6440-hub/OMOPonFHIR-OMOPv60-PSQL.git

b. docker exec -it omop_v6 psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE omop;" -c "\c omop" -c "CREATE SCHEMA results;"

c. psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d omop -f "OMOP CDM postgresql ddl.txt"

d. psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d omop -f "OMOP CDM postgresql pk indexes.txt"

e. psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d omop -f "OMOP CDM Results postgresql ddl.txt"

f. psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d omop -f "OMOP CDM vocabulary load - PostgreSQL.sql"

g. psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d omop -f "omoponfhir_f_person_table_ddl.txt"

h. psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d omop -f "omoponfhir_v6.0_f_observation_view_ddl.txt"

i. docker exec -it omop_v6 /bin/bash 
j. su postgres 
k. psql omop < names.dmp
l. psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d omop -f "insert_names_to_f_person.sql"

Please refer to the document for more detail on Data Loading. 



### 2. Execute workflow manullay from Github Action UI in Github.com

## Automation of Web application Build and Deployment

Web Application build and demployment to hosted runner server is fully automated with github action workflow https://github.com/tarunchy/OmopOnFHIR/blob/main/.github/workflows/pipeline.yaml. The workflow gets triggered based push of code to main or master branch or based on pull request approval and merge to main branch. 

## End To End Testing

Once workflow is complete we can validate if application is up and runnring by opening a browser window and trying access following URL:

http://runner_host_IP:8080/omoponfhir4

Note: Runner Host IP information needs to be updated in following files:

https://github.com/tarunchy/OmopOnFHIR/blob/main/Dockerfile

Both workflow file and Docker files has DB password in plain text which is not recommended. However as DB will be behind the firewall it wont accessable outside. So testing purpose its mentioned here. However developer when working on their own branch needs to change this.
